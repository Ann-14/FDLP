<h2>The Inicis</h2>

<p title="The Inicis">
Today I'm gonna explain my babus story. Are you ready? Well, everything started in a very far place frome her home. Sant Andrew's.
She had choose to study Translation cause she loved reading her fantasy books in english.
In those books she found the loves of her life. Homens amb magic.</p>

<h2> The English classes (where her love for me started) </h2>

<p title="The English classes"> 
    The english class can also be known as the room of love. This is where my babus first saw me.
As soon as she did, her life changed. Her heart told her she had found the one. So now she had made a plan
to get me inside her web. Firstly, she started making noises with her notebook. That way I only looked at her and not
at the teacher. Secondly, she started putting cookies in my iogurt. That was her venom. That's how she convinced me to 
go to her place.</p> 



<h2>Friday's at her place </h2>

<p title="Friday's at her place">
    Because of the venom she had put in my iogurt I accepted the invitation of going to her place on Friday.
She was alone (you might want to note this) and she said we where there to watch Harry Potter.
When she showed me her room I thought I was meating a murderer. If you want to know why, you might clic on this

I tried to act normal and we watched the first film. When we finished she prepared lunch and that's the moment I knew something was wrong.
Let's put it this way. Her cooking skills where frightening. She knew I was vegetarian and I didn't eat milk or cheese 
so I thought there wasn't going to be a problem since she was making pasta. Well... 
<a href= "http://jugandoconfogones.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/macarrones-cocidos-300x225.jpg" target="_blank"> THIS </a> was my lunch:
<br>Now, you might be thinking this was the pasta before putting the sauce. YOU ARE WRONG. She wasn't feeling like opening a sauce since 
I was the only one eating it so she asked if oil was enough. Me being polite and scared for my life I told her It was more than
enough. And to this day that was the worst and untasty dish of pasta I've ever eaten. And I still have nightmares about it.



    

<h2> My good influence</h2>
<p title="My good influence">
    After a few months she started to realize I was her favourite person to be with so she started skipping class with me.
That way we could visit some places in Barcelona or just lay on the University grass enjoying the morning sun. she eventually started skipping dance classes so that we could eat some popcorn in her grandma's sofa. We also
watched an entire tv series called "Cites". We talked for hours and hours and eventually had our first formal date
at a restaurant closed to the beach. When she called her mum to tell her la sra Neus said: "Ja m'ho imaginava..."
She was also the one who told her to be clean and whom we have to thank for telling all the family about me without us knowing.
She's nice even though she opens the door without knocking and tells us that keeping the door open would be nice. 10 points
for intimacy.
</p>


<h2>Things I found amousing about her</h2>
At that time she wasn't the person she is now. And she did a lot of things that I found really strange and funny at the
same time. Here is a list of stuff that I rembember. I may add some more if I remember:

<ul>
    <li>She didn't consider macarrons pasta. She said els espirals de verdura eren pasta. Els macarrons, macarrons. </li>
    <li>She used to bring with her an umbrella on sunny days cause her mum told her it was going to rain.</li>
    <li>She had to cook the hamburguer using a special pan cause that's how it was supposed to be according to her.</li>
    <li>She always had to eat an starter and a main course even if the starter was bigger than my main course.</li>
    <li>She always used the biggest escurridor even if she had cooked 4 macarrons.</li>
    <li>She had to fold her socks separately and keep them like that in her wardrobe.</li>
    <li>She thought breakfast consisted of 4 cookies or any similar shit.</li>
    <li>She used to wear the same earings she wore when she was 3.</li>
    <li>She wasn't allowed to wear her pijamas at home if it wasn't sleeping time.</li>
    <li>She didn't own sports clothes or comfort clothes.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Our first trip together </h2>
<p>
    After a year of dating we decided to go to Brussels to get to know each other better and see if I could stand her 
    for 5 days without getting apart. They turned to be 15 days but we might get there later.
    Prior to our trip I decided to get trekking boots since it was going to be cold and I didn't own trekking boots for cold
    weather. Well, she thought I was crazy. She said: What do you mean?! How was I gonna wear those boots in the city?
     She looked at me as if I was going to look homeless. But after some talking she decided to get one pair as well but she promised herself she
    wasn't going to wear those boots anywhere else. She didn't want people she knew to see her wearing those.
    Well... they ended being one of her favourite shoes to wear everywhere. <br>
    I also explained to her that I was going to wear the same sweatpants probably everyday and I would only
    pack a spear of jeans just in case. She again thought I was crazy. "Sweatpants? While visiting a city? You won't be doing
    any sport..." And once again, she ended up doing the same once she realized how comfortable that was.
    When we arrived in Brussels I told her we weren't going to eat at restaurants. They were expensive and didn't have
    food that I could enjoy since I was vegetarian. "What do you mean? How are we going to survive!?
    And after those words I was commited to show her how the world of supermarkets worked. How 
   by combining the right products at the right time and using the right tools we could "cook" our own meals using less
   money and having fun doing it. And since then, going to supermarkets has become one of our favorite activities.
</p>

<h2>Being a Brujilla aprendiz</h2>
<p>
Being home for 24h, 365 days a year can change your personality and being around the biggest Bruja can make you become
one. And that's what happened when she started sharing a place with Carmen. She became one little Carmen. The first time
I saw that happening I was scared AF. She was starting to make fun of us. Being mean and making uggly jokes. She started 
getting dress on the corridor after doing pipi, getting change in the middle of the living room, deciding that things had
to be done right away. They also started fighting each other since they were fighting for being the best bruja in the house.
So while one made fun of the other's clothes, the other made fun of the other's hair. They also made fun of each other 
when the other one won the rummikub game.
